Project: Calculator

I am really proud of this one, because it took me 30 days to come to the point where I am able to build this, starting with absolutely zero touch with HTML, CSS and JavaScript ever in my life.

Calculator is functional. 

It displays ERROR whenever you execute a math operation which provides a result greater than 1 000 000. 

It also displays only 9 digits including a decimal point and always calculates the number of digits before displaying the result.

If the number of digits exceeds 9, calculator cuts off the exceeding digits and rounds the 9th digit accordingly.
